# Calculator

The purpose of this assignment was to develope the back end of a calculator application. The GUI (graphical user interface) has been provided by the instructor. The Stack and Queue will be written using the LinearList implementation. The application accepts infix expressions as input, convert the infix expression to postfix, evaluate the expression, and display the result in the calculator GUI.

This project consists of six files:
1. Calculator.java: the graphical interface (provided)
2. LinearList.java: The linked list implementation of the LinearListADT interface, from project #2
3. LinearListADT.java: The linear list interface, from project #2 (provided)
4. Stack.java: The stack, which uses the LinearList implementation
5. Queue.java: The queue, which uses the LinearList implementation
6. ExpressionEvaluator.java: The back end program that contains the logic needed to evaluate the expression and update the GUI.
